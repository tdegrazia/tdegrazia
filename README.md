  <p align="left">
After casually perusing YouTube, much like many individuals did in 2020 during the Covid pandemic, I stumbled upon a couple videos related to programming. This unintended encounter ignited an interest in the subject, propelling me into a compelling journey. After recognizing a potential love for the subject, I promptly enrolled in a Computer Science course upon my return to school in 2022.

The course not only solidified my passion but also introduced me to my favorite high school teacher and, subsequently, my favorite class. Following this revelation, I made the decision to relocate from Upstate New York to California to pursue a Computer Science major at Pomona College. During my freshman year, I predominantly focused on my coursework, ensuring a strong foundation in the field.

However, in more recent times, I have cultivated a deep appreciation for personal projects. While I am still in the early stages of my academic and professional journey, my love for the topic still grows. I am enthusiastic about engaging in additional projects and look forward to the continued development of my skills and knowledge in the realm of computer science.

When I'm not immersed in coding or on the baseball field, you'll find me in nature, exploring trails and embracing the outdoors on hikes. As an adrenaline enthusiast, I engage in various activities, including snowboarding, ice skating, surfing, and even the occasional skydiving experience. To counteract the impact on my nervous system, there's nothing quite like stargazing during a camping trip.
